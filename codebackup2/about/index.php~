<title>About Wikipedia views</title></head>

<body>

<p><strong>Wikipedia Views</strong> is a minimalistic website intended
for people who're looking for information on how frequently particular
Wikipedia pages or collections of pages get viewed.</p>

<h3>Behind the curtain</h3>

<strong>Wikipedia Views</strong> has been developed
by <a href="http://vipulnaik.com">Vipul Naik</a> using PHP and
MySQL. Special thanks go
to <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> for help
with overcoming some of the coding hurdles that needed to be cleared
to get to functioning code. We rely on statistics
from <a href="http://stats.grok.se">stats.grok.se</a>.</p>

<p>The development began in </p>
<h3>Pageview data fetching and caching</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><strong>How we retrieve and cache data</strong>: Here's how it
works. When you send your list of (page, month, language) combinations
for which you want statistics fetched, we check, for each combination,
if we already have cached data for it in our internal MySQL
database. If we do, we serve the cached data. Otherwise, we fetch the
data by making a HTML page request
to <a href="http://stats.grok.se">stats.grok.se</a> and parsing the
HTML output to extract the number of pageviews, and then cache
it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Current month exception</strong>: The following
exception to caching is worth noting: we do not cache, or look for
cached values, for the number of pageviews in the <em>current</em>
month, because these values are changing daily.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Timeout restrictions</strong>: For any individual page
load, our timeout restrictions limit us to about 50 page requests to
stats.grok.se (fetching the pageviews for a given page, month, and
language requires 1 page request). However, it is possible to display
more than 50 pieces of data if some of them have already been
cached.</p></li>
